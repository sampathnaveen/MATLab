Limited the band bending to WDm.
Plotted p(x) and n(x) as a function of x for positive x values (only in the semiconductor). Hint: Since p and n are large numbers, use a semilog coordinates
Instead of defining 𝜓s as an input to the code, expand the code that it would take VG, thickness of the oxide (d), and the oxide permittivity and calculate based on that.
