Ask for the metal work function and calculate Ï†ms.
Ask for total trapped charges in the oxide (Qf+Qm+Qot) and calculate VFB 
Note: you do not need to ask for separate values of Qf, Qm, and Qot just the total as one number is sufficient.
Apply the VFB value to your developed code in MATLAB or Excel file to plot the energy diagram.
Add to the code to plot not only the semiconductor section, but the metal and the oxide.
