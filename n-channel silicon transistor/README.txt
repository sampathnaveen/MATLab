Design an n-channel silicon transistor with the threshold voltage of 0.5 V. Assume (Qf+Qm+Qot)=0.
Clarification: Design means that you are free to choose the gate material (but you have to specify it and just the work function value is not enough), NA, and SiO2 thickness (d). The design here means that you should show your hand calculation.

Using your HW4 code plot the energy diagram for:
a. Vg=0
b. Vg=0.5 V
c. Vg= 1.0 V

For each case on question 2, read the Wd value from the energy diagram (your simulation) and report the values.

Find the Z/L ratio if we want to obtain 1 mA at Vg=1.0 when the transistor is in the saturation mode.
