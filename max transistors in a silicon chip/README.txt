The diagram below shows the top view of a MOSFET transistor. Assume 100 nm fabrication technology (the minimum L and Z values can be 100 nm):
a.	Find the maximum number of transistors that can be accommodated on a 1cmx1cm silicon chip.
b.	For d=2 nm (thickness of the gate oxide layer), find CL in one transistor.
c.	For VDD=5 V, find the total dissipated power in the chip in part ‘a’ (1cmx1cm) when fclock= 100 MHz (assume all transistors are turning on and off together)
d.	If the thermal resistance of the chip-to-ambient is Rθ=0.5 C/W how much would be the temperature of the chip? 
e.	Is the calculated temperature at part “d” make sense?
f.	If we want to reduce the temperature of the chip to be less than 150 C, what would you recommend to change?
